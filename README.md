Ready to use cards built with angular 7 and bootstrap 4. 
A card is flexible and can contain any content. It includes options for a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.

One of the example usages could be a group of cards in a single row, and on clicking a card you could redirect or display content.
